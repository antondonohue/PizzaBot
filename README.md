# PizzaBot
## What It Does
This is a python web bot that uses selenium to order pizza from Domino's Australia.
The application has a text interface for acquiring basic user infomation required by Domino's for delivery aswell as the users desired order.

## Apparently domino's regularly changes it's pop-ups
The main use for this project was to order one of the five pizza's I always order from domino's without having to deal with the hassel of using their pop-up filled website. Ideally selenium would deal with the domino's jargen and the user would be able to order a pizza from the safety of their terminal.
However, alas, mid development domino's changed their pop-ups and the x-path that selenium used to click out of the pop-up no longer worked.
The development has halted and pizza will subsequently go uneaten.
